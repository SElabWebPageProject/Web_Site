<h1>About us</h1>
The main directions in research conducted by the Software Engineering Lab members were
<ol>
<li><h4>Semantic Methods for Information Retrieval</h4></li>
<li><h4>Computer Security</h4></li>
<li><h4>Intelligent Systems and Learning Technologies.</h4></li>
</ol>
Prof. Klyuev leads the Semantic Methods for Information Retrieval and Computer Security directions. The focus of the research by Prof. Hamada is on Intelligent Systems and Learning Technologies.<br><br>

<h2>Semantic Methods for Information Retrieval</h2>

Social networks influence the people’s life. The power of social networks is not clearly understood by the government and scientists. The early detection of antisocial behavior (ASB) in written language is an urgent problem in text mining.  In our joint project with colleagues from the University of Eastern Finland, we searched for linguistic features that pertain to ASB in order to use those features for the automatic identification of ASB in text. Results of this research are published in the Informatica journal and presented at the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (Poland, 2013).<br><br>

Another topic of our research was on investigation of main problems in opinion mining and sentiment analysis systems development. This research was done in tight cooperation with our colleagues from Polytechnical State University, Russia. Its results were presented at the  2013 International Joint Conference on Awareness Science and Technology and Ubi-Media Computing (iCAST 2013 and UMEDIA 2013). <br><br>
 
We successfully continued our joint project on semantic relatedness measures with Prof. Yannis 
Haralambous from Institute Telecom Bretagne, France. Obtained results were published in the International Journal of Computational Linguistics and Applications.<br><br>
  
<h2>Computer Security</h2>

A computer security area attracted attention of our students. Password protection issues and learning technologies to protect data stored on computers were under our investigation. The results were presented at the following conferences: 
<ul>
<li>The 9th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2014), London, 2014</li>
<li>International Journal of Computing, Vol 13, Issue1, 2014</li>
<li>The 7th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications (IDAACS'2013), Germany, 2013</li>
<li>The XLIV Conference on Control Processes and Stability (CPS'12), Russia, 2013</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h2>Intelligent Systems and Learning Technologies</h2>

Prof. Hamada continued his research on intelligent systems and learning technologies. He and his students work in developing intelligent learning system (ITS). ITSs aim to provide immediate and customized instruction or feedback to learners, usually without direct intervention from a human tutor. ITSs have the common goal of enabling learning in a meaningful and effective manner by using a variety of computing technologies. There are many examples of ITSs being used in both formal learning and professional settings in which they have demonstrated their capabilities and limitations. <br>
There is a close relationship between intelligent tutoring, cognitive learning theories and design; and there is ongoing research to improve the effectiveness of ITS. Areas that have used ITS include natural language processing, machine learning, planning, multi-agent systems, ontologies, semantic Web, and social and emotional computing. <br>
In addition, other technologies such as multimedia, object-oriented systems, modeling, simulation, and statistics have also been connected to or combined with ITS. In recent years, ITS have expanded across many critical and complex cognitive domains, and the results have been far reaching. ITS systems have cemented a place within formal education and these systems have found homes in the sphere of corporate training and organizational learning. <br>
ITS offers learners several affordances such as individualized learning, just in time feedback, and flexibility in time and space. While Intelligent tutoring systems evolved from research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, there are now many applications found in education and in organizations.<br>
In 2013 AY, Prof. Hamada and his team published one book and 10 scientific papers in journals and conference proceedings published by major publishers such as ACM, IEEE, Elsiver, etc.<br>
