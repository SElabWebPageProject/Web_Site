    <h1>International Relations</h1>
    In 2013, the University of Aizu celebrated the 20th anniversary of its founding in April of 1993. In commemoration of this occasion, several scientific events were organized. One of them was The 2013 Competitive Learning Workshop as a part of The 2013 ACM-ICPC Asia Aizu Regional Contest. We were in charge for organizing this workshop. Coaches of world leading student team were invited to share their experiences. Our guests were Prof. Jan Madey, the University of Warsaw, Prof. Vladimir Kotov, Belarus State University, Prof. Vitaly Bondarenko, the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and Prof. Tomoyuki Kaneko, the University of Tokyo. <br>
 
    Our lab in cooperation with the Active Knowledge Lab organized the 3rd International Workshop on Advances in Semantic Information Retrieval as an event of the 2013 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (Poland, 2013). We involved in this activity since 2011. This workshop is gained popularity among researchers from Europe and Asia. Selected papers from this workshop were published in the Special issue of the Informatica journal in January 2014.<br>

    Prof. Hamada was invited as a visiting Prof. at Fatih University, Istanbul Turkey for 3 months from March to May 2013. His research during this visit was funded by Istanbul foundation. In September 2013, he was invited as a visiting Prof. at the African University of Science and Technology, Abuja, Nigeria.  His research during this  visit was supported by a grant from the Word Bank. In November 2013, Prof. Hamada was invited as a visiting Prof. at Cairo University, Cairo Egypt.<br>
 
    <h2>Exchange of Undergraduate Students</h2>

    Our undergraduate students Mr. Makino and Mr. Togashi visited Saint 
    Petersburg State University, Russia in April 2013 and presented their paper at the XLIV 
    Conference on Control Processes and Stability. Our Russian partners covered local expenses 
    during the stay of our students in Saint-Petersburg.<br>
 
 
    <h2>Foreign Students</h2>

    Mr. Hsien-You Hsieh, master student from  Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan,  was enrolled in the dual-degree program (DDP) in autumn 2013.<br>

    A DDP is a system where students can earn two degrees, from the home and the partner university 
    through mutual recognition of credits attained at the universities, and the goal of the program 
    includes fostering excellent human resources educated internationally, as well as strengthening 
    relations between partner universities through concrete exchanges. The Memorandum of 
    Understanding establishing the international dual degree program for students of our university 
    and Chaoyang University of Technology was concluded in 2009.<br> 

    This is the third time when our lab welcomes the student from Chaoyang University of Technology. <br>
