<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The leading industrial countries in the world understand that computer software has become a critical<br>

element of the global society influencing virtually every aspect of human life. They consider Software<br>

Engineering as the key technology of 21st century. The Japanese government understood the<br>

significance of Software Engineering and in October 2004 established the Software Engineering Center<br>

as a structure of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency [Link: <a href="http://www.ipa.go.jp/">http://www.ipa.go.jp/</a> ]. The task <br>

of this center is to coordinate the efforts of industry, academia and government organizations to<br>

become the world's most advanced information technology nation.<br>

The mission of the Software Engineering Laboratory of the University of Aizu is to provide students with<br> 

innovative software engineering research methods and processes and to graduate specialists able to<br>

professionally develop and deploy the valued software. <br>

<h2>Research</h2>

The basic concept of our investigation can be defined as follows: If research in computer science can be<br>

categorized as either science or technology, our research focuses on science which is the analysis of <br>

natural phenomena.<br>

Web applications are the current priority of software applications and the corresponding branch of <br>

software engineering is growing very fast. Our laboratory exploits this tendency and teach our software<br>

engineering students how to develop Internet applications. Intelligent systems are crucial components<br>

of software dedicated for online communities. We explore how to creatively design and implement such systems.<br>

The immediate goal of the Software Engineering Lab is to support specialists who develop new <br>

technologies for the newer applications, to test obtained by them results in controlled experiments and <br>

offer successful technologies for use after conducting joint trial engineering experiments. Feedback at <br>

every step helps improve our research and learning.<br><br>

The main directions in research conducted by the Software Engineering Lab members are<br><br>

<ol>
  <li><h4>Semantic Methods for Information Retrieval</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Computer Security</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Technologies for Internet Applications</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Intelligent Systems and Learning Technologies.</h4></li>
</ol>
<br><br>
Prof. Klyuev leads the Semantic Methods for Information Retrieval, Computer Security and Technologies <br>

for Internet Applications directions. The focus of the research by Prof. Hamada is on Intelligent Systems <br>

and Learning Technologies.<br><br>

A new trend in computer technologies to store all the data in the cloud is rapidly gaining popularity<br>

among computer manufactures, operating systems developers, and users. As a result, there is a strong<br>

demand for intelligent semantic search technologies supporting retrieval of appropriate information<br>

from the Internet. <br>

Application running on the Web is the main trend in Software Engineering. Agility in the development <br>

and supporting technologies are in the focus of investigation. <br>

Another important issue is computer security: How to protect your data, and your privacy?  It is not easy <br>

to find answers to these questions.<br>

Artificial intelligence and learning technologies both theoretical and applications are gained popularity nowadays.<br>

For AI projects the focus lab research is on designing new language models, natural inspired <br>

computation models and intelligent tutoring systems.<br>

Learning technologies research aims at efficient learning which is highly demanded by modern societies. <br>

New technologies utilizing intelligent computer software, methodology, and experience of tutors may <br>

be very helpful in learning processes. Software Engineering Lab works on these technologies proposing <br>

prototypes of new systems.  <br>

These topics are under our investigation. Lab students are involved in this research.<br>




<h2>Information Retrieval</h2>

Software Engineering Lab is responsible for coordination joint research and education projects with<br>

partner universities: Saint-Petersburg State University [link: <a href="http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/en/ ">http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/en/</a>] and <br>

Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University [link: <a href="http://www.en.spbstu.ru/">http://www.en.spbstu.ru/</a> ].<br> 

We established mutually beneficial exchange relationships with our Russian partners: Every year,<br>

beginning from 2006, we dispatch one – two our best students to Saint-Petersburg, Russia to present<br>

their papers at the Annual Conference on Control Processes and Stability. Russian students actively<br>

participate in scientific events organized by our university.<br>

The joint research group actively works in the area of Information Retrieval and Software Engineering<br>
[link: <a href="http://kspt.icc.spbstu.ru/research/science/jgirsr/en/ ">http://kspt.icc.spbstu.ru/research/science/jgirsr/en/ </a>]. <br><br>

Software Engineering lab in cooperation with the Active Knowledge Lab organizes the International <br>

Workshop on Advances in Semantic Information Retrieval as an event of the Federated Conference on <br>

Computer Science and Information Systems [link: https://fedcsis.org/ ]. We involved in this activity since <br>

2011. This workshop is gained popularity among researchers from Europe and Asia.<br><br>

<h2>Foreign Students</h2>
Beginning from 2010, several master student from  Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan, have<br> 

been enrolled in the dual-degree program (DDP). <br> 

A DDP is a system where students can earn two degrees, from the home and the partner university<br>

through mutual recognition of credits attained at the universities, and the goal of the program includes <br>

fostering excellent human resources educated internationally, as well as strengthening relations <br>

between partner universities through concrete exchanges. The Memorandum of Understanding <br>

establishing the international dual degree program for students of our university and Chaoyang <br>

University of Technology was concluded in 2009.
